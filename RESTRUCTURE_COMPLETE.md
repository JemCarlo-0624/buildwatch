### Router System
- ✅ Created `core/Router.php` with complete routing system
- ✅ Role-based access control implemented
- ✅ Route definitions for all modules
- ✅ Updated `public/index.php` to use router
- ✅ Created `.htaccess` for URL rewriting

### Path Updates
- ✅ All `require_once` paths updated to use `__DIR__` for relative paths
- ✅ Updated config paths to use relative paths from new locations
- ✅ Updated redirect URLs to use clean routes (e.g., `/client/login` instead of `client_login.php`)
- ✅ Updated auth check includes

### Layout Updates
- ✅ Updated `core/layout.php` menu configuration with clean URLs
- ✅ Updated logout links
- ✅ Navigation links now use router-friendly paths

### Cleanup
- ✅ Deleted `php/test_java.php` (obsolete test file)
- ✅ Files organized and renamed for consistency

## 🚀 Benefits Achieved

1. **Clean URLs**: `/client/dashboard` instead of `/php/client_dashboard.php`
2. **Role Separation**: Clear boundaries between user types with organized module folders
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Related files grouped together logically
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new modules/features
5. **Security**: Centralized route protection with role-based access control
6. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns

└── php/ (old directory - can be cleaned up after verification)
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Old php/ directory**: All files have been copied to new locations. The old `php/` directory can be safely deleted after thorough testing.

2. **Database Connection**: The config path has been updated in moved files, but you may need to verify database connectivity.

3. **Session Management**: The router now handles session management centrally. Make sure session configuration is correct.

4. **URL Rewriting**: The `.htaccess` file handles URL rewriting. Make sure `mod_rewrite` is enabled in Apache.

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

1. Test all login flows (staff and client)
2. Test dashboard access for each role
3. Test CRUD operations for all modules
4. Test API endpoints
5. Test navigation links and form submissions
6. Verify role-based access restrictions

## 🔄 Migration Complete

The restructure is now complete. All files have been moved, paths updated, and routing implemented. The application should be ready to test with the new module-based structure and clean URL routing.
